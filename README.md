## ✍️ How It Works

- Each question includes a description, hint, and a correct solution.
- Students write HTML, CSS, and JS in separate fields.
- On "Submit", their answer is tested and feedback is shown.
- Alerts and prompts work as expected using `parent.alert/prompt` inside the iframe.

---

## ✅ Sample Questions

- Create a paragraph with class `greet` and style it blue
- Use text-shadow on a `<p>` element
- JavaScript: prompt for a name and greet the user
- For-loops, while-loops, if/else, switch statements
